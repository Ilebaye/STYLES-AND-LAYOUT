    <div>
        <p>Anẹ Igáláà (Igala Land), also known as the Igala Kingdom,[1] was a pre-colonial 
            West African state, located at the eastern region of the confluence of River Niger 
            and River Benue in the Middle Belt or North-central of Nigeria.[2] The kingdom was 
            founded by the Igala people, with the "Àtá" Serving as the Igala Emperor, national 
            father and spiritual head, and the capital of Igala land is at Idah. The Igala Kingdom 
            influenced and has been influenced by the Yoruba, Idoma, Igbo and Jukun, and is likely 
            made up of descendants of these groups who settled and mixed with the native Igala populations.</p>

        <p>àbó igáláà = people

            ìchòlò/ùchòlò = culture
            
            íchí Igáláà = Igala language
            
            The etymology of the term "Igala" itself may be derived from "Iga" which means a partition, blockade,
             a dividing wall, and "Ala" which means "sheep". Iga-ala thus became Igala. The reason for this form of
              self identification is currently debated by scholars. However, a possible theory designates the citizens 
              of the kingdom as the sheep, and the state being the wall or defence that protects them.</p>

        supreme, that out of his supremacy he gave powers and authorities to the gods and spirits over the different 
        spheres of human life. These gods and spirits have practical dealings with human beings in their everyday life 
        activities.[2] Ifa, is the traditional belief of the Igalas and is still practiced by many. This system of worship
