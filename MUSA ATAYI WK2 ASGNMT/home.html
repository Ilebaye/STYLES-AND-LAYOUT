        <h1 class="history1">The History of Igala People</h1>
        <p>Anẹ Igáláà (Igala Land), also known as the Igala Kingdom,[1] was a pre-colonial West African state,
        located at the eastern region of the confluence of River Niger and River Benue in the Middle Belt or 
        North-central of Nigeria.[2] The kingdom was founded by the Igala people, with the "Àtá" Serving as the 
        Igala Emperor, national father and spiritual head, and the capital of Igala land is at Idah. The Igala 
        Kingdom influenced and has been influenced by the Yoruba, Idoma, Igbo and Jukun, and is likely made up of 
        descendants of these groups who settled and mixed with the native Igala populations.</p>
    </div> <br><br><br>

    <div class="religion">The Igala traditional concept of God is a belief in the Supreme Being whom they call Ọjọ. Ọjọ is held so supreme, 
    that out of his supremacy he gave powers and authorities to the gods and spirits over the different spheres of human life</div>
    <div class="political">The Àtá's court is known as the Ogbede which is a building that that Àtá holds court within with its head being known as the Ogbe
     or president of court. The Amedibo are the royal servants and the Amonoji are Àtá's eunuchs</div>
    <div class="subdivision">Anẹ Ígáláà has nine traditional ruling councils, including the capital Idah. The nine councils each has a King (onu) who is appointed 
    by religious rite through a complex system of traditional rite and proceedings supervised by the head of the council, the Àtá Ígáláà in Idah.</div>
